            <div class="bio-title">NNAM?</div>nnam is an Afrikan artist reflecting the time. The 21 year old’s experimental, dark psychedelic music melds hip hop, free jazz, soul, folk, electronic and afro styles for transcendent sonics. With an equally accosting and romantic pen, powerful lyrics on struggle, love, and self are punctuated by their crooning soulful vocals and witty flows. An Aghem raised in Maryland, nnam grew up listening to gospel, afrobeats, pop-rock, and makossa at home, quickly growing fascinated with many other music styles encountered outside. Enchanted by the beauty of word and sound, nnam began singing and writing  music at 7. They’ve played guitar since 7th grade rock band class, and began producing music in high school.

            <br><br> Naming Nina Simone, Dijon, Don Cherry, Lauryn Hill, Noname, and MIKE as major influences, nnam’s beauitful bending of sound is critical to their pursuit of truth in all mediums. Each song is a means of revelation and revival. Led by water, nnam’s soundscape draws audiences closer to the reality of freedom within nature.
